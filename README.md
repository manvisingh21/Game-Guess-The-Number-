The "Guess the Number" app project encompassed the development of an Android application utilizing Android Studio. The project architecture featured two primary activities: InstructionActivity and MainActivity.

InstructionActivity served as the informational hub, providing users with comprehensive instructions on gameplay mechanics. Employing meticulous design, instructions were strategically centered both vertically and horizontally, accompanied by a distinguished heading for optimal visual hierarchy. The UI was meticulously crafted with a refined color palette and meticulous margin adjustments, enhancing user engagement and comprehension.

Upon user interaction, transitioning to MainActivity seamlessly ensued. MainActivity hosted the core gaming experience, where users engaged in number selection and guess submissions. Interface elements were thoughtfully centered, ensuring a harmonious user interaction paradigm.

Functional aspects of the app encompassed dynamic user input for setting target number ranges and submitting guesses. The application adeptly managed user interactions, delivering real-time feedback on guess accuracy while maintaining a count of attempts. Upon successful guess submission, a tailored congratulatory message was presented.

Collectively, the project demonstrated adept proficiency in Android application development, showcasing adept utilization of Java and XML within Android Studio. The resultant product exemplifies a polished and professional user experience, showcasing a mastery of technical implementation and user-centric design principles.
